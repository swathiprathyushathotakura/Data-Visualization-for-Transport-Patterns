Interactive Transport Analytics Dashboard (D3.js, Leaflet, Python, Pandas)

Developed an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize and analyze transport and commuter flow data across multiple regions. Using Python and Pandas, large datasets containing traffic volume, route efficiency, and commute times were cleaned, aggregated, and transformed into structured formats for visualization. The processed data was integrated into a D3.js dashboard that enables users to explore travel trends, congestion zones, and peak-hour activity through interactive charts and maps.

The system features animated bar charts, route heatmaps, and geospatial visualizations built with Leaflet.js, allowing users to zoom into regions and filter data by day, route type, or area. Dynamic tooltips, smooth transitions, and real-time updates create a responsive and engaging analytical experience. Summary cards display total trips, average trips per hour, and active routes, updating instantly with each filter selection.

To ensure scalability and performance, D3.js rendering was optimized for efficient data binding and transitions, providing smooth updates even with large datasets. The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for transport planners by identifying high-traffic routes, underutilized corridors, and temporal travel patterns.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data visualization, geospatial analytics, and front-end engineering, effectively bridging raw data with actionable insights. The result is a high-performance, interactive platform that enhances urban mobility analysis and supports evidence-based improvements in transportation planning.
